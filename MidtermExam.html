<h1> Rebuilding Notre Dame: The
     next steps for Paris’s famous cathedral</h1>

<p><br>Officials began inspecting the damage of Notre Dame Tuesday. They declared the
  cathedral structurally sound while identifying “some vulnerabilities,” according
  to French Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez. Specifically, the vault and
  gable of the north transept were of concern. Inspectors are also worried about
  structural damage that may be hidden.</br></p>

<p>Kirk Martini, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Architecture
  with a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in structural
  engineering, said the transept is probably the greatest vulnerability. To
  ensure the structure is stable, additional shoring may be necessary after the
  full extent of the damage is assessed.</p>

<p>Limestone is a key building element of the structure, and stone is susceptible
  to damage from heat and water. “There may have been some damage to the stone,
  even the places that currently appear to be intact . . . because of the weaknesses
  of the material,” Martini said. “That’s a big unknown. . . . I don’t think anybody
  knows the extent of that damage.""</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron hopes the country can rebuild Notre Dame within
  five years. With the scale of the project, Martini is skeptical that timeline
   will be met, even with the number of resources being promised for restoration.
   Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been pledged for the rebuilding
   efforts.  How the cathedral will be restored is also up for debate. On Wednesday, Prime
   Minister Édouard Philippe announced an international competition to replace the iconic spire
   that collapsed into Monday’s blaze.</p>

<p>Notre Dame is of geographic and cultural importance to Paris. It sits
  purposefully near the center of the city on a small island surrounded by
  the Seine River. It is also the landmark next to which all other Parisian
  monuments are measured.</p>

<h2>The Plan of Action</h2>

<p>Martin Moeller, senior curator for the National Building Museum in Washington,
  said it is not coincidental that Notre Dame is one of the most famous Gothic churches.
  “The plaza in front of the cathedral was built specifically to give a good
  viewing point,” he said. “It's not an accident that so many people have taken
  photographs of the front of the church.</p>

<p>”There is already a debate brewing about how the church should be restored.
    Whether the efforts will include building materials similar to destroyed in
    the fire or more modern materials will be up for more discussion once officials
    fully assess the damage, to the building and to its artifacts.</p>
<p>Much of the art and relics were saved from the flames. The cathedral’s large
   stained-glass windows appear to be undamaged, and there’s a strong case for
   restoring the famed structure as closely as possible to its former glory.</p>

<p>Even the White House offered assistance in the rehabilitation of the
    cathedral. While Notre Dame is revered around the world, Moeller stressed the
   importance of considering how other catastrophic fires of major landmarks are
   handled.</p>

<p>In St. Landry Parish, La., three black churches burned down from arson within
   10 days in late March and early April. Before Monday, a GoFundMe for the churches
   had raised just below $50,000 in rebuilding aid. After a Twitter campaign urged
   people to remember the Louisiana churches amidst the devastation of Notre Dame,
  the  total skyrocketed to $1 million by Wednesday.</p>

<p>“Obviously it's one of most famous buildings in the world,” Moeller said of
    Notre Dame. “But we want to make sure that people remember that there are other
    buildings that are important to other communities. It may not be as famous,
    but when tragedy strikes there it can be devastating to a particular community
    or a particular group of people, and sometimes it doesn't get the attention
    it deserves.”</p>
