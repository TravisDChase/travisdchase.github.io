<h1> Rebuilding Notre Dame: The next steps for Paris’s famous cathedral</h1>

<p>Officials began inspecting the damage of Notre Dame Tuesday. They declared the
  cathedral structurally sound while identifying “some vulnerabilities,” according
  to French Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez. Specifically, the vault and
  gable of the north transept were of concern. Inspectors are also worried about
  structural damage that may be hidden.</p>

<p>Kirk Martini, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Architecture
  with a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in structural
  engineering, said the transept is probably the greatest vulnerability. To
  ensure the structure is stable, additional shoring may be necessary after the
  full extent of the damage is assessed.</p>

<p>Limestone is a key building element of the structure, and stone is susceptible
  to damage from heat and water. “There may have been some damage to the stone,
  even the places that currently appear to be intact . . . because of the weaknesses
  of the material,” Martini said. “That’s a big unknown. . . . I don’t think anybody
  knows the extent of that damage.""</p>

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron hopes the country can rebuild Notre Dame within
  five years. With the scale of the project, Martini is skeptical that timeline
   will be met, even with the number of resources being promised for restoration.
   Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been pledged for the rebuilding
   efforts.
