  <p>The effect of the COVID-19 virus on economies and businesses across
     the world has been unprecedented. From families to countries around
     the world, precautionary and quarantine methods have been taken to
     reduce the spread of the virus. Likely one of the most unexpected
     outcomes of the virus: the shutdown of the billion-dollar NBA industry.</p>

  <p>On March 11th, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/coronavirus-knicks-owner-james-dolan-joins-durant-gobert-among-nba-figures-to-test-positive-for-covid-19/">Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive</a> for
    the coronavirus, which led the NBA to halt its season for the
    foreseeable future. Prior to the diagnosis,Gobert had been joking
    around with members of the media by touching objects in the media
    room. At the time,“Gobert didn’t realize he had contracted the
    virus”, which put many other people at risk.</p>

  <p>In a video posted by Gobert on his twitter account, he apologized
     for being careless and urged everyone to take the virus seriously.
     In the video, Gobert said,<a href="https://twitter.com/rudygobert27/status/1238197356987899905?s=20">“It's all about protecting yourself
     and the people around you. I wish I would have taken this thing
     more seriously and I hope everyone else will do so because we can
     do it together. Take care and stay safe.”</a></p>
  <p>The decision to put games on hold came as a shock to many players
     and staff employed in the league. Any games after March 12th would
     either be postponed or cancelled. The league was faced with a decision
     of whether to push the season back, cancel some games, or cancel the
     rest of the season entirely. This decision left many NBA players in
     shock.</p>
  <p>A day after Gobert tested positive,<a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/coronavirus-knicks-owner-james-dolan-joins-durant-gobert-among-nba-figures-to-test-positive-for-covid-19/">Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz,
    also tested positive for the coronavirus.</a> The diagnosis of the two
    players “was” problematic, but the issue was that neither player showed symptoms.
    This prevented the league from acting urgently to slow the spread of
    the virus.</p>
  <p>On March 14th, Detroit Pistons forward, Christian Wood tested positive
    for the coronavirus. A few days later on March 17th, it was announced
    that Forward, Kevin Durant and three other Brooklyn Nets players had
    tested positive for the coronavirus. Only one of the four players showed
    symptoms of the virus.</p>
  <p>On March 19th,between players and staff on four different teams, seven
     different people tested positive for Covid-19. These teams include the
     Lakers, Nuggets, Sixers and Celtics. Most recently on March 28th,
     New York Knicks owner, James Dolan, tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>

  <p>These cases are even more reason to close all NBA facilities. However,
    many people have posed the question, how much money could the NBA lose it
    if it doesn’t continue its season? The predictions are over a billion
    dollars. According to to WVEC, <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/video/money/nba-faces-serious-potential-revenue-loss-from-coronavirus/65-424b5a47-889e-4ec5-87f7-1f96a016a6ba"> an ABC-affiliated television station,</a> the NBA
    had earned $8 billion in revenue in 2018, but due to the coronavirus, the
    NBA is expected to lose more than $1 billion. Commissioner Adam Silver said
    the league would close its doors for at least a month. The NBA is still working
    its way to fill a viable solution to continue the 2019-2020 season after the
    hiatus and rumors of potential revenue loss.</p>

  <p>NBA owners have most recently lobbied for the NBA season to continue
    during the summer despite the 2020-2021 season start date being so close.
    <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-how-the-nba-is-planning-to-save-its-season.html">The potential site for the end of this season, according to a CNBC report,
    is Las Vegas at the Thomas and Mack Center.</a> It would be at a smaller venue
    and would be played there without fans.</p>
  <p>As for whether the NBA would finish the regular season or start from the
     playoffs is up in the air. One thing is for certain though, the Coronavirus
     has put the NBA and the rest of the world on hold.</p>
