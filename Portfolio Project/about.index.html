  <p>I am currently a student in the Merril College,
    school of Journalism at the University of Maryland.
    I've always had an interest in sports journalism.
    I also am interested in possibly fimlming sports
    documentaries. I also wouldn't mind being on camera
    having a diverse skillset as a journalist.<p>
